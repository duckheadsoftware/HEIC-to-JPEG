# HEIC-to-JPEG
A suite of software to help convert HEIC photos while protecting privacy by allowing the removal of personal information (not in HEIC to JPEG). From the no fuss HEIC to JPEG, through to HEIC Converter, there’s something for everyone’s expertise and needs.

This is the official repo for issue tracking, a place where people can report bugs, provide general feedback, and make feature requests.
